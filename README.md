A local network throughput loopback test of an esp8266 over virtual com ports.

You will need:

- [purebasic](http://www.purebasic.com/)
- esp8266
- [platformio](http://platformio.org/)
- [com0com](http://com0com.sourceforge.net/)

This was an experiment is quantifying throughput and latency values for a wireless link. This link will someday serve as a high bandwidth USB cdc-acm alternative in a future project.

My time was limited and this is only a Windows solution until someone can tell me how to setup com0com like functionality under other platforms.
